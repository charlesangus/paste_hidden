# Requirements: paste_hidden

**Defined:** 2026-03-12
**Core Value:** Copy and paste must reconnect predictably — anchors provide stable, navigable references; hidden inputs reconnect to their source without ceremony.

## v1.2 Requirements

### CI/CD

- [ ] **CI-01**: Tag push to GitHub triggers a workflow that runs offline tests, packages plugin source files into a versioned ZIP, and creates a GitHub Release
- [ ] **CI-02**: ZIP release artifact uses an explicit file manifest — excludes `tests/`, `validation/`, `.planning/`, `__pycache__`

### Bug Fixes

- [x] **BUG-01**: Links receive their anchor's tile_color in all code paths (not default purple in any scenario)
- [x] **BUG-02**: Anchor node pasted cross-script stays an anchor — not converted to a link node (regression fix)

### Code Quality

- [ ] **QUAL-01**: Moderate code quality sweep using ruff + radon — dead code removed, unused imports cleaned, over-complex conditionals simplified; no API breaks, no serialized knob string values renamed

### Test Infrastructure

- [ ] **TEST-01**: `nuke -t` validation scripts written covering StubNode/StubKnob assumptions and cross-script paste behavior
- [ ] **TEST-02**: Any stub/mock inconsistencies found by validation scripts corrected in `tests/`
- [x] **TEST-03**: `tests/conftest.py` created with shared stubs — fixes pytest flat-discovery Qt stub ordering conflicts (4–8 spurious errors)

## Future Requirements

### Navigation

- **NAV-03**: Full browser-style forward/back navigation history stack (deferred from v1.0)

### Color

- **COLOR-V2-01**: Manual tile_color changes by user propagate to link nodes (explicitly by-design deferred)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| nuke -t in CI pipeline | Nuke requires commercial license; not available on GitHub-hosted runners |
| Rename serialized knob string constants | Would silently break all existing .nk files saved by the artist |
| Undo/redo stack integration | Nuke API complexity, not requested |
| Cross-script reconnection for hidden-input Dot nodes | Explicitly excluded — Dots are positional/ad-hoc |
| External persistence (database, remote API) | Local-only plugin |
| Multi-user / shared anchor libraries | Single-artist tool |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| TEST-03 | Phase 8 | Complete (2026-03-13) |
| BUG-01 | Phase 9 | Complete |
| BUG-02 | Phase 9 | Complete |
| QUAL-01 | Phase 10 | Pending |
| CI-01 | Phase 11 | Pending |
| CI-02 | Phase 11 | Pending |
| TEST-01 | Phase 12 | Pending |
| TEST-02 | Phase 12 | Pending |
