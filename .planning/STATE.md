# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-12)

**Core value:** Copy and paste must reconnect predictably — anchors provide stable, navigable references; hidden inputs reconnect to their source without ceremony.
**Current focus:** v1.2 Hardening — Phase 8: Test Infrastructure Stabilization

## Current Position

Phase: 8 (Test Infrastructure Stabilization) — In progress
Plan: 1 of 1 complete
Status: Phase 8 plan 01 complete; phase complete pending any additional plans
Last activity: 2026-03-13 — Phase 8 Plan 01 executed (centralized stub infrastructure)

```
v1.2 Progress: [#---------] 4% (1/1 plans complete in Phase 8)
```

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**Phase 8 Plan 01 decisions:**
- StubKnob.name() method added; factory functions pass knob name to StubKnob so addKnob() stores correctly by name
- unittest discover requires -t . flag (workspace as top-level dir) to trigger tests/__init__.py; this is the correct usage for package-structured test suites
- conftest.py uses MagicMock (not types.ModuleType) for PySide6 sub-modules so attribute access auto-creates (required for colors.py subclassing QtWidgets.QDialog)

**v1.2 phase ordering rationale:**
- Phase 8 first: flat-discovery test suite has 4-8 spurious errors; unreliable suite cannot gate regressions
- Phase 9 before sweep: bugs must have regression tests before QUAL-01 to prevent sweep from silently reverting BUG-01/BUG-02 fixes
- Phase 10 before CI: ZIP file manifest must reflect final source state; writing CI first risks stale manifest
- Phase 12 last: nuke -t validation scripts confirm final code shape; any drift corrected in tests/ only
- [Phase 09-cross-script-paste-bug-fixes]: Patch link.find_node_color (not paste_hidden.find_node_color) for BUG-01 test — find_node_color lives in link.py namespace
- [Phase 09-cross-script-paste-bug-fixes]: Mock paste_hidden.setup_link_node in BUG-02 test to avoid nuke.toNode(preferences) error while still exposing createNode/delete assertions
- [Phase 09-cross-script-paste-bug-fixes]: BUG-01 fix: removed ANCHOR_DEFAULT_COLOR overwrite after setup_link_node() in paste_hidden() cross-script link branch — setup_link_node() already sets anchor's real color
- [Phase 09-cross-script-paste-bug-fixes]: BUG-02 fix: replaced anchor-to-link replacement block with unconditional continue — anchor pasted cross-script stays as anchor, KNOB_NAME cleanup deferred to QUAL-01
- [Phase 10-code-quality-sweep]: tabtabtab.py per-file-ignores: B008/C901/SIM/E501 suppressed — vendored third-party code must not be modified
- [Phase 10-code-quality-sweep]: menu.py F401 suppressed via per-file-ignores — imports used in Nuke string-eval menu callbacks, ruff cannot see through string arguments
- [Phase 10-code-quality-sweep]: line-length=100 in pyproject.toml reduces E501 violations from 78 to 21 in source files without touching any code
- [Phase 10-code-quality-sweep]: anchor.py SIM108: two ternary collapses applied (suggest_anchor_name and pre_color assignment)
- [Phase 10-code-quality-sweep]: colors.py C901: eventFilter and keyPressEvent suppressed with noqa: C901 — inherent Qt event dispatch complexity
- [Phase 10-code-quality-sweep]: colors.py B007: all 4 unused loop variables renamed with _ prefix — none captured in lambdas or inner functions
- [Phase 10-code-quality-sweep]: paste_hidden C901 suppressed with noqa on def lines — structural refactoring deferred due to recent BUG-01/BUG-02 fixes and in-place selected_nodes mutation
- [Phase 10-code-quality-sweep]: FROZEN annotation pattern established: comment on line immediately above each serialized constant

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Test suite flat-discovery Qt stub ordering conflicts RESOLVED (Phase 8 Plan 01 complete; was 5 errors, now 0).
- Note: full suite requires `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/ -t . -p "test_*.py"` (with -t . flag) for tests/__init__.py to trigger. Without -t ., stubs are not pre-installed.
- nuke -t validation (Phase 12) is MEDIUM confidence on license type (nuke_r vs nuke_i) and `nuke.root().name()` default in headless — spot validation against local Nuke install required before writing final scripts.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-03-14T12:50:43.181Z
To resume: Phase 8 has 1 plan (08-01 complete). Phase 8 is complete. Run `/gsd:plan-phase 9` to continue.

Phase 8 completed: centralized stub infrastructure in tests/stubs.py + conftest.py. Full suite passes: 130 tests, 0 errors.
