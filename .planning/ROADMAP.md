### 🚧 v1.2 Hardening (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Fix cross-script paste regressions, stabilize test infrastructure, sweep code quality, and add CI/CD packaging pipeline.

- [x] **Phase 8: Test Infrastructure Stabilization** - Fix flat-discovery Qt stub ordering conflicts so the test suite is a reliable feedback mechanism
- [ ] **Phase 9: Cross-Script Paste Bug Fixes** - Fix BUG-01 and BUG-02 in paste_hidden.py with regression tests
- [ ] **Phase 10: Code Quality Sweep** - Dead code removal, unused import cleanup, complex conditional simplification
- [ ] **Phase 11: CI/CD Pipeline** - Tag-triggered GitHub Actions workflow: offline tests, versioned ZIP, GitHub Release
- [ ] **Phase 12: Nuke -t Validation Scripts** - Manual developer validation confirming stub behavior matches real Nuke runtime

## Phase Details

### Phase 8: Test Infrastructure Stabilization
**Goal**: The test suite passes cleanly under flat discovery so it can serve as a reliable regression gate for all subsequent work
**Depends on**: Nothing (first v1.2 phase)
**Requirements**: TEST-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `pytest tests/` (flat discovery) completes with zero errors and zero failures
  2. `tests/conftest.py` exists and provides the authoritative shared Qt and tabtabtab stubs for all test files
  3. All individual test files continue to pass when run in isolation
  4. No per-file stub installation remains that could conflict with conftest stubs
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — Create tests/stubs.py + tests/conftest.py, strip per-file stub blocks from 5 test files

### Phase 9: Cross-Script Paste Bug Fixes
**Goal**: Anchors pasted cross-script stay anchors, and NoOp links pasted cross-script receive the correct anchor tile_color — both with regression test coverage that guards the subsequent quality sweep
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: BUG-01, BUG-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A NoOp link pasted into a different script shows the anchor's tile_color, not the default purple
  2. An anchor node pasted into a different script remains an anchor node, not a link node
  3. Regression tests for both bugs exist in `tests/` and pass under flat discovery
  4. `pytest tests/` remains green after both fixes are applied
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 09-01-PLAN.md — Write failing regression tests (TestBugRegressions class with BUG-01 and BUG-02 tests — RED phase)
- [ ] 09-02-PLAN.md — Apply BUG-01 and BUG-02 fixes to paste_hidden.py; confirm full suite green

### Phase 10: Code Quality Sweep
**Goal**: The source files are cleaner — dead code removed, unused imports eliminated, overly complex conditionals simplified — with no API breaks, no behavior changes, and no serialized knob string values altered
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Requirements**: QUAL-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `ruff check` (rules E, F, W, B, C90, I, SIM) reports zero violations across all source files
  2. All serialized knob name constants in `constants.py` are annotated as FROZEN and none have been renamed
  3. `pytest tests/` remains green after every sweep commit touching `paste_hidden.py`
  4. No public function or class API is changed (no callers broken)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 11: CI/CD Pipeline
**Goal**: A tag push to GitHub triggers offline tests, packages plugin source into a versioned ZIP, and publishes a GitHub Release — with the ZIP containing only end-user files and no dev artifacts
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Requirements**: CI-01, CI-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Pushing a version tag (e.g., `v1.2.0`) to GitHub triggers the workflow and produces a GitHub Release
  2. The GitHub Release contains a ZIP artifact with only the plugin source files (no `tests/`, `validation/`, `.planning/`, `__pycache__`)
  3. The workflow runs offline tests (`pytest tests/`) and fails the release if tests fail
  4. A locally unzipped copy of the release artifact contains exactly the expected files and no extras
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 12: Nuke -t Validation Scripts
**Goal**: A developer running the validation scripts against a local licensed Nuke install can confirm that StubNode/StubKnob assumptions in `tests/` match real Nuke API behavior, and that the BUG-01 and BUG-02 fixed code paths work correctly under a real runtime
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: TEST-01, TEST-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `validation/validate_stub_alignment.py` exists and runs to completion under `nuke -t` without errors
  2. `validation/validate_cross_script_paste.py` exists and smoke-tests the BUG-01 and BUG-02 fixed paths under `nuke -t`
  3. Any stub or mock inconsistencies found by the scripts are corrected in `tests/` and `pytest tests/` remains green
  4. Validation scripts never import `menu.py` and never reach Qt dialog code paths in headless mode
**Plans**: TBD
